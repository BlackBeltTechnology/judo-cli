This code provides a structure for handling the main commands and demonstrates key functionality. Here's the implementation approach:

Command Structure: Uses Cobra CLI to create a hierarchical command structure matching the shell script's functionality.

Docker Integration: Implements Docker operations using exec.Command to run docker CLI commands.

Maven Integration: Handles Maven builds by constructing appropriate command arguments.

Port Checking: Includes waitForPort function similar to shell script's functionality.

Error Handling: Central error checking with checkError function.

Configuration: Loads properties from judo.properties files.

To complete the implementation:

Add remaining subcommands (clean, prune, update, etc.) following the same pattern

Implement all helper functions (container operations, file operations, etc.)

Add proper configuration loading from properties files

Implement remaining features like schema upgrades, database dumps, etc.

Add platform-specific handling where needed

Implement comprehensive error handling

Add validation for command arguments

The code uses Go's standard libraries for OS interactions and Cobra for CLI structure. It maintains the same logical flow as the original shell script while leveraging Go's type safety and error handling.
