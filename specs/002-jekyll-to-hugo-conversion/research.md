# Research: Jekyll to Hugo Migration Patterns

## Hugo vs Jekyll Feature Parity

### Template Language Differences
**Decision**: Use Hugo's Go templates with equivalent Liquid functionality
**Rationale**: Go templates provide similar logic with different syntax; Hugo's template functions cover most Jekyll features
**Alternatives**: Custom shortcodes for complex Liquid logic, Hugo Pipes for asset processing

### Asset Pipeline Comparison
**Decision**: Hugo Pipes for Sass compilation and JS bundling
**Rationale**: Built-in asset processing with fingerprinting and minification
**Alternatives**: External build tools (Webpack, Parcel) would add complexity

### JavaScript Integration
**Decision**: Hugo's JS build pipeline with ES6+ modules
**Rationale**: Native support for modern JavaScript with bundling optimization
**Alternatives**: External bundlers would require additional configuration

## Design System Migration

### CSS Architecture
**Decision**: Convert Sass to Hugo's asset pipeline with CSS custom properties
**Rationale**: Maintains design consistency while leveraging Hugo's built-in processing
**Alternatives**: Keep external Sass compilation would add build step complexity

### Theme Switching
**Decision**: Preserve CSS custom properties approach with JavaScript enhancement
**Rationale**: Maintains identical user experience with system preference detection
**Alternatives**: Hugo theme system would require complete redesign

## Performance Optimization

### Build Performance
**Decision**: Enable Hugo's build caching and incremental builds
**Rationale**: Significantly faster build times compared to Jekyll
**Alternatives**: Minimal build optimization would miss Hugo performance benefits

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: GitHub Actions with Hugo deployment via `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` (Hugo 0.150.0, Node 18, environment `pages`)
**Rationale**: Seamless integration with existing workflow
**Alternatives**: Netlify or other platforms would require new configuration

## Content Structure Discovery
**Issue**: API, examples, and session pages were located in `/docs/` instead of `/docs/content/`
**Solution**: Files moved to proper Hugo content directory structure
**Files Affected**: `api.md`, `examples.md`, `session.md`
**Impact**: Pages now properly served at `/api/`, `/examples/`, `/session/` URLs
