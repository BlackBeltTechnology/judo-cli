# Feature Specification: Convert Jekyll Documentation to Hugo

**Feature Branch**: `002-jekyll-to-hugo-conversion`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to convert jekyll based site to hugo, because it's more suitable solution for a go application. I would like to adapt the custom design elements from jekyll"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a JUDO CLI user, I want to access documentation that maintains the same visual design and user experience as the current Jekyll site, but is built with Hugo for better integration with the Go-based CLI tool and improved performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the documentation homepage, **When** they view the site, **Then** they should see the same hero section with animated SVG background and orange-red accent colors
2. **Given** a user wants to read command documentation, **When** they navigate to commands section, **Then** they should find the same content structure and formatting as the current site
3. **Given** a user prefers dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme switch, **Then** the site should switch to dark theme with proper contrast and logo adaptation (logo changes from dark text to white text)
4. **Given** a developer wants to install JUDO CLI, **When** they view the install tabs, **Then** they should see OS-specific commands with copy-to-clipboard functionality
5. **Given** a user accesses the site on mobile, **When** they browse the documentation, **Then** the responsive design should work identically to the current implementation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? (theme toggle should degrade gracefully)
- How does the site handle missing pages or broken links? (maintain same 404 behavior)
- What happens when system theme preference changes while browsing? (should auto-adjust if no manual selection)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Documentation site MUST maintain identical visual design including orange-red accent color scheme (#eb5a29)
- **FR-002**: Site MUST preserve dark/light theme switching with system preference detection
- **FR-003**: All interactive components MUST work identically (install tabs, copy buttons, mobile navigation)
- **FR-004**: Content structure and navigation MUST remain unchanged from current Jekyll implementation
- **FR-005**: Site MUST maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- **FR-006**: Build process MUST integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflows (build.yml for CLI; hugo.yml for docs)
- **FR-007**: Documentation URLs and permalinks MUST remain stable to avoid broken links

### Key Entities
- **Documentation Page**: Represents individual documentation content with front matter metadata, content, and layout assignment
- **Theme Configuration**: Defines color schemes, typography, and design tokens for both light and dark modes
- **Interactive Component**: JavaScript-enhanced UI elements like theme toggles, install tabs, and copy buttons
- **Layout Template**: Defines page structure and includes partial components like header and footer
